# Swagger Editor Validate Github Action

This GitHub Action validates OpenAPI (OAS) definition file using [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/193286/110246148-b7aea580-7f66-11eb-9bd7-940ece1fc6b0.png)

It's handy for use-cases when OAS definition is maintained manually and is checked within the git.
If modifications are made to the OAS definition you want to make sure that there are no errors
introduced by modifications. Errors that would appear in Swagger Editor when the OAS definition
would be pasted inside it.

## Inputs

### `swagger-editor-url`

**Optional** Defines URL of [swagger-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-editor) where definition
file is going to be validated. Default `https://editor.swagger.io/`.

## Example usage

There are two major use-cases of how to use this GitHub Action.

### Public use-case

If you have access to the internet and don't mind that this action sends your OAS definition
to https://editor.swagger.io/ for validation.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  test_swagger_editor_validator_remote:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Swagger Editor Validator Remote

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Validate OpenAPI definition
        uses: char0n/swagger-editor-validate@v1
        with:
          definition-file: examples/openapi-2-0.yaml
```

### Private use-case

If you want to maintain complete privacy and your OAS definition may contain
sensitive information use the following workflow. The workflow uses swagger-editor
docker image that runs as service of the workflow.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  test_swagger_editor_validator_service:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Swagger Editor Validator Service

    # Service containers to run with `runner-job`
    services:
      # Label used to access the service container
      swagger-editor:
        # Docker Hub image
        image: swaggerapi/swagger-editor
        ports:
          # Maps port 8080 on service container to the host 80
          - 80:8080

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Validate OpenAPI definition
        uses: char0n/swagger-editor-validate@v1
        with:
          swagger-editor-url: http://localhost/
          definition-file: examples/openapi-2-0.yaml
```
